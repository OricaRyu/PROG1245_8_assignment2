                <b>David Eric Grohl</b> was born in Warren, Ohio, on January 14, 1969. He formed his <u>first band</u> at age 10. He dropped out of high school to play with the hardcore group <strong>Scream</strong> before auditioning for <b>Nirvana</b>. <strong>Nirvana</strong> went on to be an international hit and they ended up signing with <u>Geffen Records.</u> Their first release with them, 1991’s <em>Nevermind</em>, became a huge hit, driven in part by the single, “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” While <b>Cobain</b> handled most of the songwriting duties, all three band members had worked on the track, which combined elements of punk, metal and pop. After singer <b>Kurt Cobain's</b> death, <strong>Grohl</strong> formed a commercially successful alternative band called the <b>Foo Fighters</b>. The first <b>Foo Fighters</b> album as a band, <em>The Colour and the Shape</em>, came out in 1997. The album made it to the top ten of the album charts and featured such tracks as “Monkey Wrench,” “Everlong” and “My Hero.” Repeating this feat with 1999’s <em>There Is Nothing Left to Lose</em>, the <b>Foo Fighters</b> won their first Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2000. The album had one breakaway single in “Learn to Fly,” and the video for the song won the group their <u>first Grammy Award in 2000</u> for Best Short Form Music Video. Over the years, <b>Grohl</b> has recorded with other bands, including <b>Queens of the Stone Age</b> and <b>Tenacious D</b>, but he continues to circle back to the <strong>Foo Fighters</strong>. The group has since released <em>Wasting Light</em> (2011), <em>Sonic Highways</em> (2014), <em>Concrete and Gold</em> (2017) and <em>Medicine at Midnight</em>em> (2021). "Run" off <em>Concrete and Gold</em> claimed best rock song at the Grammys in 2018. <em>Medicine at Midnight</em> won best rock album, best song with "Waiting for a War" and best rock performance with "Making a Fire" in 2022.
